## About Swift

Announced in 2014, the Swift programming language has quickly become one of the fastest-growing languages in history. Swift makes it easy to write software that is incredibly fast and safe by design. Our goals for Swift are ambitious: we want to make programming simple things easy, and difficult things possible.
